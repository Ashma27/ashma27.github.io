                        <p>These Terms incorporate a Privacy Policy, which you are also deemed to agree with.</p>
                        <p>From time to time, we may update these Terms, the Privacy Policy, our rates, or other aspects of our business without prior notice. It is your responsibility to review these Terms from time to time, and to become aware of and understand any changes. After any such update, your continued use of this Site or any of our services means that you agree with the updated Terms.</p>
                        <p>Who We Are and What We Do. BESTOVER25GOALSTIPS is a website that provides access to sports information, specializing in expert opinions on the possible outcomes of sports events (the ‘Tip’ or ‘Tips’). A Tip may include (1) the appropriate types of bets available from independent gaming sites (simple bet home/draw/away, over/under, asian handicap etc.); and (2) the best odds available from such gaming sites.</p>
                        <p>Not a Gambling Site. In connection with the Tips, we do not accept any wages or stakes. You cannot bet on our Site. While you can buy Tips on this Site, the purchase price is only for the opinion presented in the Tip, and does not depend on the odds or actual outcome of the sporting event. We do not pay out any winnings and take no risk or position on the results of the event. It is your sole responsibility to act on the Tips, and any wins or losses that you may obtain from using such Tips to bet with independent gaming sites is for your sole account. We have no affiliation with any gaming site or any gambling operator.</p>
