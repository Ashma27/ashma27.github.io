                            <div class="pr get-hide2"><p>You are probably under a lot of pressure right now. We commend you for acknowledging you are going through a problem probably caused by circumstances beyond your. Time is likely not on your side so it is important to take action before its too late. If you are compelled to sell your property fast, this is the place to start. We are here to help and ensure the process is simple and straightforward.</p></div>
                            <div class="pr pr-hw"><p class="pr-hw">Our home buying process consists of five simple steps:</p></div>
                            <h3>1. Initial Consultation</h3>
                            <p>As the first step to solve your real estate problems, we sit down with you and listen to your situation. We then proceed to ask you the few questions to get the information we need in or to know This is the opportunity for you to ask us as many questions as you like. If you are satisfied, we’ll proceed to the next step. Based on your valuation of the property, our real estate professionals will offer you a guide as how much we can offer for it in return for a all cash sale.</p>
                            <h3>2. We Do a Thorough Situation Analysis and Valuation</h3>
                            <p>At this stage, we compile a few extra details about the property and it’s current situation. We process this information to generate a financial analysis of the property. The results of this step will yield a accurate valuation and possible exit strategies or solutions to your problem. This allows us to prepare a fully researched formal offer for you to ensure we achieve a win-win scenario.</p>
                            <h3>3. We Offer You Money for Your House</h3>
                            <p>We make you an offer. Most time we make all cash offers. However, from time to time and depending on the situation, we may propose a terms or financing offer (or some other creative solution). There is no obligation for you to accept it.</p>
                            <h3>4. You Evaluate The Offer We Made For Your Property</h3>
                            <p>We provide you with the opportunity to evaluate our offer. Selling your house is a life changing experience. We provide you with enough information to make an informed decision about selling your house. The ball is in your court and you are in control. We encourage you to take as much time as you need to decide if you want to sell.</p>
                            <h3>5. If You Agree to the Offer and we Sit Down At Closing</h3>
                            <p>If you agree to the offer, we’ll arrange a cash transaction and pay you your money. There are no hidden fees or costs involved. What we offer you is what you get, and nothing less.</p>

Hundreds of thousands of people find themselves in a rush to sell their property every year. Most of them end up losing their homes to their bank, their debtors, the government or their homeowners association. We have helped many people in your situation. We understand what you are going through, your challenges and your fears. When you talk to us, we will work diligently to understand your real estate problem and offer you an effective solution.</p></div>
                            <div class="pr1"><h3>Who Will Buy My House?</h3></div>
                            <p>We are a group of experienced real estate investors with members in every major market in the US and Canada. Although some of us hold real estate licenses, we are not real estate agents by trade. We buy all types of houses across the country. A Realtor will make you sign a contract just to list your house on your local MLS and hope for a buyer to come around. We instead will make you a serious cash offer to buy your house using our own money.</p>
                            <div class="pr"><p>Our goal isn’t to take advantage of you. Our goal is to offer you a fair solution to your problem in the shortest time possible. Even if we don’t end up buying the house, we are happy to help you fix your real estate problems. We routinely help homeowners refinance, find tenants, correcting code violations and settling liens and other legal issues.</p></div>
                            <div class="pr"><p>Think of us as your real estate problem solvers. We help people solve their real estate problems. Homeowners who are at risk of losing their house come to us after failing to sell their houses through traditional means, or when they are simply out of time. In most cases, these homeowners need to sell their house fast and we are able to make them a serious cash offer and buy their house.</p></div>
                            <div class="pr1"><h3>What Types of Houses Are We Looking For?</h3></div>
                            <p>We buy most types of real estate including Single Family Houses, Condominiums Townhomes, Mobile Homes and Vacant Lots. As long as the property can be developed into a residence, we are interested. If you have a type of property that you are not sure we buy, please contact us anyway.</p>
                            <div class="pr"><p>We are looking for houses of all sizes and conditions and we don’t care if your house is new, old or ugly. We want to buy your house, even if it has zero (or even negative) equity, even if it is in such a poor condition that no bank is willing to finance any potential buyers, even if it has liens, code violations, and other legal problems attached to it!</p></div>

                            <p>(i) The types of information we collect when you use our service;  </p>
                            <p>(ii) How we use, share, and protect that information; </p>

                            <p class="cap_bold">TYPES OF INFORMATION WE MAY GATHER </p>
                            <p>Information you may provide while visiting our website includes Personally Identifiable Information and Non-Personal information. </p>
                            <p class="bold">What is Personally Identifiable Information? </p>
                            <p>Personally Identifiable Information (PII) means any information you actively provide to us that can be used to identify you, such as your name, telephone number, address, etc.  We collect PII on this website through forms, such as contact forms and that you may submit when communicating with us. In addition, when you visit our website, we will record your computer IP address and/or unique mobile device ID, and may tie it to your specific account. Under ordinary circumstances, an IP address recorded in isolation is not PII under the standard definition of the term. 
                                However, it may become PII when it is combined with other information, as in this case.  </p>
                            <p class="bold">What is Non Personal Information? </p>
                            <p>Non-Personal Information is information that does not identify you, and may include statistical information concerning the pages on our website that users visit most frequently. General Information of this nature is collected through a small piece of computer code called a “cookie,” and includes your computer IP address, unique mobile device identifier, browser type, ISP or carrier name, and the URL of the last webpage you visited before visiting our website.
                                This information gives us insights on how our users use our site and our services. 
                                We use this information to ensure that our service continues to appeal to our users. </p>
                            <p class="cap_bold">HOW WE USE INFORMATION </p>
                            <p class="bold">How We Use PII </p>
                            <p>We use PII to interact with you on a personal level and to provide you with the specific information you may request from us through our website. 
                                We do not share your PII with any third parties, other than as set forth herein. </p>
                            <p class="bold">How We Use Non-Personal Information </p>
                            <p>We use Non-Personal Information to analyze the effectiveness of our website, and for other internal purposes, and
                                may therefore share this information with third parties for this purpose. 
                                Any information we may share will not include Personal Information. </p>
                            <p class="cap_bold">HOW WE SHARE INFORMATION </p>
                            <p>Except for the circumstances listed below, we will not share PII with anyone other than those employees and contractors who need access to it in order to perform their job functions.
                                Notwithstanding other provisions of this policy, we may disclose your PII to the following types of third parties without your express consent in the following circumstances: </p>
                            <p><span>(1) Web Service Providers:</span> We may employ third-party web service providers to perform functions on our behalf, 
                                such as maintaining and providing services for our website (including e-mail transmission, 
                                web download management, and other communication functions). To secure these services, 
                                it may be necessary to share your information with these third parties, 
                                but only to the degree necessary to ensure proper delivery of the services we request.
                                These third parties are expressly prohibited to use PII for any other purpose, 
                                or to retain such information after the requested services are provided. </p>
                            <p><span>(2) Regulators and Court Orders: </span>
                                We may reveal your PII on a case-by-case basis in order to comply with court orders,
                                official investigations, and in similar involuntary circumstances.Unless instructed otherwise,
                                we will make every effort to inform you when we have received a request to dis close your Personal Information in this fashion. </p>
                            <p><span>(3) Official Requests: </span>If requested or required by law enforcement authorities,
                                courts, or regulators, we may disclose any information we have collected from you.
                                We also may disclose your information to exercise or protect our legal rights or to defend against legal claims.</p>
                            <p><span>(4) Asset Transfers: </span>In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets.
                                In these business transfers, customer information is typically one of the business assets that are transferred. 
                                Moreover, if all or substantially all of our business assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that we go out of business or enter into bankruptcy,
                                customer information (including your PII), would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.
                                You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any assets may continue, to be used as set forth in this policy. </p>
                            <p class="cap_bold">HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION </p>
                            <p>Our website and the server(s) upon which it is hosted use a generally accepted standard of technological security for the purpose of protecting all information provided by visitors from unauthorized access, loss, destruction, damage, misuse, loss, or corruption. <span>We also </span>
                                limit access to PII to those employees who reasonably need access to it to deliver our service.  </p>
                            <p>However, because no security system can be 100% effective,
                                we cannot completely guarantee the security of any information we may have collected from or about you.  In addition, we have no control over the security of other web sites on the Internet that you might visit even when a link may appear to those web sites site from our Site.
                                If you share your computer or use a computer that is accessed by the general public, remember to sign off and close your browser window when you have finished your session.If there is a breach of security,
                                then we may either post a notice through the service or attempt to notify you via email so that you can take reasonable protective steps. </p>
                            <p class="cap_bold">HOW LONG WE RETAIN INFORMATION </p>
                            <p>Unless you request that we delete some or all of the PII you provide to us,
                                we will retain it for as long as we deem necessary to fulfill a business purpose or comply with a legal request.
                                We reserve the right to retain non-personal information for as long as we deem necessary. </p>
                            <p class="cap_bold">YOUR OPTIONS AND CONTROL </p>
                            <p>You can change your decision to be contacted by us via telephone or email (opt-out) at any time by informing our agent over the phone,
                                or by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link included in every email. </p>
                            <p class="cap_bold">TRACKING TECHNOLOGY </p> 
                            <p>We employ certain applications that enable us to track your online activities over time and across third-party Web sites. We offer no response to Do-Not-Track requests transmitted by Web browsers,
                                but you can limit tracking in certain browsers by adjusting your browser settings. </p>
                            <p class="cap_bold">UNDERAGE USERS </p>
